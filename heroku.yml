  docker:
    # Tells Heroku to use the Dockerfile in the root directory
    # to build the image for the 'web' process type.
    web: Dockerfile
    # If you had other process types (e.g., worker), define their Dockerfiles too:
    # worker: Dockerfile.worker
  # You can specify build-time config vars if needed, though often
  # ARG defaults in the Dockerfile or runtime vars are sufficient.
